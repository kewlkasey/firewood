Firewood Stand Check-in Feature - Product Requirements Document
Introduction:
BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING, ask any necessary questions you have for me as your employer about the below experiences. You may know more about the project than the person that created this document, so please confirm if you think you have a better alternative or if you are very confident, proceed.

I’d expect our sequence of events to be:
This prompt
You ask me questions
I answer those questions and then you provide me with requested changes (in common language) to supabase AI for database changes
Supabase provides confirmation and details to me which i provide to you.
You build the remaining functionality as described in the feature brief.

Executive Summary
This document outlines the product requirements for implementing a Foursquare-style check-in system for the firewood stand application. The feature will allow users to verify stand conditions, update inventory status, confirm payment methods, leave reviews, and upload photos to keep the community informed about stand availability and quality.
Product Overview
Vision
Create a community-driven verification system that ensures accurate, up-to-date information about firewood stands while building user engagement and trust in the platform.
Goals
Provide real-time inventory and payment type acceptance verification
Enable community-driven content through photos and reviews
Improve data accuracy through crowdsourced updates
Build user engagement similar to location-based social platforms
User Stories
Primary Users
Authenticated Users (both owners and consumers): Registered users who can, confirm stand information, leave ratings, and comment full reviews
Unauthenticated Users: Visitors who can check-in and leave comments but not ratings; comments are primarily for context of check-in and not necessary the rating
Stand Owners: Users who own/manage firewood stands (future consideration)
Feature Requirements
1. Check-in System Core Flow
1.1 Check-in Initiation
Acceptance Criteria:
Check-in button is prominently displayed on stand detail pages (already implemented)
Button triggers check-in modal/flow that should overlay the stand page.
System captures check-in timestamp and user location (if permissions granted)
Each check-in creates a record in the database for audit purposes (unknown if existing audit trail table exists)
Make the check-in experience as simple as possible
1.2 Inventory Level Confirmation
Acceptance Criteria:
Present current inventory level from database as default selection
Provide four radio button options: Empty, Low, Medium, High (pre-selected based on current data)
Request user to confirm or update inventory level
Request user to input amount paid per quantity
Update firewood_stands table with new inventory level
Create audit trail of inventory changes
1.3 Payment Methods Confirmation
Acceptance Criteria:
Display all current payment methods for the stand
Show each payment method with a checkbox (pre-checked based on current data)
Allow users to uncheck methods that are no longer available
Update firewood_stands table with confirmed payment methods
Log payment method changes in audit trail
1.4 Rating System (Authenticated Users Only)
Acceptance Criteria:
Incorporated in the check-in flow
Display 1-5 star rating interface for authenticated users
Show login button with "Sign in to leave a rating" for unauthenticated users
Rating is optional - users can skip this step
Store rating in the appropriate reviews table with user_id, stand_id, rating, timestamp
Calculate and display average rating on stand page
Do not count check-ins with no star ratings in the formula.
Display individual ratings in reviews section
1.5 Comment System (All Users)
Acceptance Criteria:
Provide optional text area for comments (max 500 characters)
Available for both authenticated and unauthenticated users
Include character counter
Basic profanity filter (implement simple word list)
Store comments in reviews table
For unauthenticated users: store with user_id as NULL and capture IP for moderation
3. Photo Management
3.1 Photo Upload
Acceptance Criteria:
Allow users to upload 1-3 photos per check-in
Allow users to use their camera or camera roll to upload photos.
Support common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
Implement client-side image compression (max 2MB per image)
Store photo URLs in photos array field in reviews table
Display uploaded photos in the check-in confirmation
Add photos to stand's photo gallery
3.2 Primary Photo Suggestion
Acceptance Criteria:
Include checkbox "Suggest as primary photo" (default: unchecked)
One one photo in the check-in should be checked as “suggested as primary photo”. We cannot use a radio button because it should be able to be unchecked after being checked.
If checked, log suggestion in stand_verifications table with type "primary_photo_suggestion"
If stand has no primary photo, automatically set first uploaded photo as primary
Display suggested primary photos in admin view (future enhancement)
Update firewood_stands table primary_photo field when appropriate (future enhancement)
4. Data Updates and Audit Trail
4.1 Stand Information Updates
Acceptance Criteria:
Use most recent check-in data to update stand information
Update inventory_level in firewood_stands table
Update payment_methods in firewood_stands table
Update last_verified timestamp in firewood_stands table
Create entry in stand_verifications table for each check-in
4.2 Audit Trail
Acceptance Criteria:
Log all changes to stand information with timestamp and user
Display audit trail at bottom of stand page (collapsed by default)
Include: date, user (if authenticated), changes made, and verification type
The Check-Ins section at the bottom of the page should show each check-in, with or without comment, with or without rating. If any photos are added with the check-in, also show the photo thumbnails with the comment. Display comments chronologically on stand page. Display with the user’s profile photo cropped in a circle (placeholder silhouette for now), user’s initials and rating, if any. Price paid, if provided.
Format COULD be something like: "Updated 2 hours ago by John D. - Inventory: Medium → High, Payment Type: Added Venmo"
Maybe have a detailed view that shows the changes FROM and TO but the basic view just shows the basic information. 
Technical Requirements
Database Schema Changes
Provide the prompt you think necessary for Supabase AI to make any necessary updates (create tables if they do not exist, updated columns, etc.).
Security Considerations
Authentication
Use Supabase Auth for user verification
Implement rate limiting (max 10 check-ins per user per day)
Validate user permissions for sensitive operations
Data Validation
Sanitize all user inputs
Validate and appropriately image uploads (file type, size, dimensions)
Implement basic content moderation for comments
User Experience Requirements
Check-in Flow UX
User clicks "Check-in" button on stand page
Modal opens with current stand information pre-populated
User confirms/updates inventory level
User confirms/updates payment methods
User optionally adds rating (authenticated) and/or comment
User optionally uploads photos
User submits check-in
User confirms check-in
Success message displays with thank you and updated information
Mobile Responsiveness
Optimize for mobile-first design
Ensure photo upload works on mobile devices
Implement touch-friendly star rating interface
Performance Requirements
Check-in submission should complete within 3 seconds
Photo upload should show progress indicator
Stand page should update immediately after check-in
Success Metrics
User Engagement
Number of check-ins per month
Percentage of users who complete full check-in flow
Photo upload rate per check-in
Data Quality
Accuracy of inventory levels (measured by subsequent check-ins)
Freshness of stand information (time since last verification)
User retention rate after first check-in
Community Building
Number of reviews per stand
Average rating trends over time
User-generated photo contributions
Future Enhancements
Phase 2 Features
Gamification (points, badges, leaderboards)
Check-in streaks and rewards
Stand owner notifications
Advanced photo moderation
Phase 3 Features
Seasonal availability tracking
Mobile app with offline check-in capability
Acceptance Testing
Test Scenarios
Authenticated User Full Check-in: User logs in, updates inventory, confirms payments, adds 5-star rating, uploads photo, suggests as primary
Unauthenticated User Check-in: Guest user updates inventory, adds comment, uploads photo
Data Consistency: Multiple users check-in to same stand, verify most recent data is used
Photo Management: Upload photos, verify primary photo logic works correctly
Audit Trail: Verify all changes are logged and displayed correctly
