Based on my analysis of the database schema and functions, here are the answers to the questions:

Yes, the firewood_stands table does have all the new fields mentioned in the requirements. The current schema includes: bundled_flag, loose_flag, self_serve, payment_type, location_type, hours_availability, seasonal_availability, contact_phone, delivery_available, submitted_by_user_id, last_verified_date, and photo_urls (as an array field).

Yes, there is a stand_verifications table for tracking user verifications of stands. Its schema includes: id (uuid), stand_id (uuid), user_id (uuid), verified_at (timestamp with time zone), verification_notes (text), and created_at (timestamp with time zone).

Multiple photos are handled through the photo_urls field which is an array field (text[]). The firewood_stands table has both a single photo_url field (text) and a photo_urls array field, suggesting a transition or dual approach to photo storage.

There are several existing functions for fetching stand details:

get_nearby_stands: Returns stands with details within a specified radius
The stands_with_details view joins firewood_stands with profiles and reviews to provide comprehensive stand information including owner details and ratings
Yes, there are existing verification-related functions:

get_stand_verification_stats: Returns verification statistics for a stand
get_user_stand_verification: Returns the last verification timestamp for a specific user and stand
update_stand_verification_date: A trigger function that updates the last_verified_date on the firewood_stands table
The firewood_stands table has both user_id and submitted_by_user_id fields. The user_id appears to be the owner/manager of the stand, while submitted_by_user_id tracks who originally submitted the stand information.

The verification system doesn't have explicit prevention of duplicate verifications in the database schema. The get_user_stand_verification function suggests that the application might check for previous verifications, but there's no database constraint preventing multiple verifications from the same user.

Payment_methods are stored as a text array (payment_methods text[]). There's also a payment_type field with specific allowed values: 'Cash Register', 'Honor System', and 'Delivery Payment'.

Wood_types are stored as a text array (wood_types text[]). There's no constraint on the values, so formatting may vary.
