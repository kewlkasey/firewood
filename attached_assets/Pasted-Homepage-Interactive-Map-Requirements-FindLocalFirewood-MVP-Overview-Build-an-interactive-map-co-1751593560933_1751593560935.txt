Homepage Interactive Map Requirements - FindLocalFirewood MVP
Overview
Build an interactive map component for the FindLocalFirewood homepage that displays nearby firewood stands within 25 miles of the user's location (or default location). Note: The current map section on the homepage does not load properly and needs to be rebuilt.
Technical Stack Requirements
Framework: Next.js with TypeScript
Map Library: Leaflet (load via CDN: https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js)
CSS: Load Leaflet CSS via CDN: https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css
Data Source: Supabase PostgreSQL database
Styling: Tailwind CSS with brand colors
Icons: Lucide React icons for UI elements
Location & Data Requirements
Default Location Handling
Primary: Use user's current geolocation if available/permitted
Fallback: 36300 Front St, New Baltimore, MI 48047 (coordinates: 42.6369, -82.7326)
Error Messaging: Show user-friendly message if geolocation fails, then use fallback
Radius: Display stands within 25 miles of user's location (or fallback location)
Database Integration
Table: firewood_stands
Filter Criteria:
Display both approved (is_approved = true) and pending (is_approved = false) stands
Within 25-mile radius of user location
Required Fields: id, stand_name, address, lat, lng, payment_methods, is_approved, average_rating (if reviews exist)
Connection: Use existing Supabase client from lib/supabase.ts
Map Display Requirements
Basic Map Setup
Container: Fit into existing homepage map section
Desktop Size: Full width of container, appropriate height for homepage layout
Mobile Size: Full width, ~300px height for mobile devices
Default View: Center on user location (or New Baltimore fallback)
Zoom Level: Appropriate to show 25-mile radius area
Tile Layer: OpenStreetMap tiles (free)
Map Controls
Zoom Controls: Standard zoom in/out buttons
Refresh Button: Button to refresh both location and stand data
Loading State: Show loading indicator during data fetch and map initialization
Stand Markers & Interaction
Marker Display
Approved Stands: Forest green (#2d5d2a) pin markers
Pending Stands: Orange/amber (#f59e0b) pin markers for pending approval
Hover Effect: Subtle scale/highlight on hover
Click Behavior: Open popup with stand details
Popup Content
When clicking a stand marker, display popup containing:
Stand Name (heading text, eventually will be clickable link)
Full Address (street address)
Distance (calculated from user location, e.g., "2.3 miles away")
Payment Methods (display as icons with legend)
Star Rating (display average rating if reviews exist, or "No ratings yet")
Get Directions (placeholder text for now - will eventually link to default map app)
Close Button (X in top-right corner)
Payment Method Icons
Important: Use existing payment method icons and styling that are already implemented in the project. Maintain consistency with the current directory page implementation for:
Cash/Cash Box
Venmo
PayPal
Zelle
Reference the existing directory-page.tsx component for the exact icon implementation.
Legend Requirements
Location: Display either overlay on map or below map
Content: Show what each payment method icon represents
Style: Small, unobtrusive but clearly readable
Error Handling & UX
Geolocation Handling
Permission Denied: Show message "Location access denied. Showing stands near New Baltimore, MI" and use fallback
Geolocation Error: Show message "Unable to get your location. Showing stands near New Baltimore, MI" and use fallback
Timeout: 5-second timeout, then fallback with message
Data Loading
Loading State: Show spinner/loading indicator while fetching stands
No Data: If no stands found in 25-mile radius, show "No firewood stands found in your area"
Error State: Handle database connection errors gracefully
Distance Calculation
Method: Calculate straight-line distance between user location and each stand
Units: Display in miles (e.g., "2.3 miles away")
Precision: One decimal place
Component Structure

Database Query Requirements
Include both approved and pending stands
Calculate distance for each stand
Only return stands within 25-mile radius

Handle empty results gracefully
Styling Requirements
Brand Colors: Use forest green (#2d5d2a) for pins and accents
Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach
Accessibility: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
Performance: Lazy load map to not block page rendering
Future Considerations (Not MVP)
Dedicated Map Page: Full-featured map page with address search functionality
Stand page links (placeholder in name for now)
Advanced filtering options
Real-time directions integration
Clustering for many nearby stands
User reviews and ratings display
Testing Requirements
Test Data: Use existing 28 test stands in database
Location Testing: Test both with and without geolocation permission
Responsive Testing: Verify mobile and desktop layouts
Error Testing: Test network failures and empty data states
